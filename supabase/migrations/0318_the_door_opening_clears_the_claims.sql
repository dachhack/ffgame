-- 0318 — THE DOOR OPENING CLEARS THE CLAIMS (v0.434.8).
--
-- Founder: "I set waivers to run at 2pm then opened free agency but the
-- waivers still ran at 2pm. Can we sweep for conflicts and changes like that?"
--
-- WHAT HAPPENED. With free agency off, every add is a claim, and 0291 stamps
-- a claim with the league's next run — 2pm. Opening free agency changed
-- nothing about those claims: their stamp still said 2pm, and the run reads
-- the stamp. Meanwhile the players they named had become free agents, so
-- from the moment the door opened until 2pm anyone could add one outright —
-- and the claim behind him, filed first and fair, would lose 'player taken'
-- at the run. The setting change and the pending state disagreed, and the
-- pending state won.
--
-- THE SWEEP. Every commissioner setting that touches the wire, against the
-- state it can leave behind:
--   • run time / run days      — 0292 already re-dates holds and claims. ✓
--   • hold days                — same. ✓
--   • FREE AGENCY off→open, off→window, window hours, after-waivers days
--                              — nothing re-dated, nothing settled.  ← this
--   • agent waivers off        — the worker stops filing; the claims it had
--                                already filed still win at the run.  ← this
--   • waiver mode / budget     — pending bids re-checked against the new
--                                budget at the run ('insufficient FAAB'). ✓
--                                (Budget changes reset spending by design;
--                                both consoles send it only when edited.)
--   • roster / position limits — re-checked per claim at the run. ✓
--   • the vampire's wire lock  — 0316. ✓   the guillotine's chop — 0221. ✓
--   • trades moving a claim's drop or add — 0316 / 'player taken'. ✓
--
-- THE RULE, in three places so no path can miss it:
--   1. process_waivers: a claim on an UNHELD player is due whenever the add
--      market is open, whatever its stamp says. The stamp is a forecast; the
--      open door is the fact. This alone fixes the founder's league, for
--      any way the door gets opened — the console, a data migration, a
--      window arriving.
--   2. submit_waiver_claim and _restamp_waiver_clocks: the stamp forecasts
--      it — LEAST(the run, the door) for an unheld player — so the claim
--      screen tells the truth about when it clears.
--   3. set_transaction_rules: settles what its own change made due, in the
--      same transaction, so the claims filed behind a shut door get their
--      man before the first hand at the open one; and cancels the worker's
--      pending claims when agent waivers are switched off.
-- add_free_agent's pre-add sweep (0289) now settles ANY pending claim on the
-- player, not only the due-by-stamp ones — the door is open, so they are due.
